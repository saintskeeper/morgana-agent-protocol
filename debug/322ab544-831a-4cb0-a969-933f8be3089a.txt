feat: add PostgreSQL connection hardening and Railway deployment support

Implement comprehensive database connectivity improvements for production Railway deployments:

Database Connection Enhancements:
- Add connection retry logic with exponential backoff (5 attempts, 1s-16s delays)
- Implement password masking in logs for security
- Add database type tracking (postgres/sqlite)
- Optimize connection pool settings for production (max 100 conns, 10 idle, 1hr lifetime)
- Add helper methods: GetDatabaseType(), GetConnectionPoolStats(), GetDatabaseVersion()

Configuration & Startup Validation:
- Add DATABASE_URL format validation in production (reject SQLite, require postgres://)
- Implement fail-fast behavior: refuse to start with SQLite in production
- Add detailed startup logging with database statistics
- Add actionable warnings for empty databases with recovery instructions

Health Check Improvements:
- Enhance /health/db endpoint with database type, version, and connection pool stats
- Add new /health/diagnostics endpoint with production readiness checks
- Add connection pool usage monitoring (warn at 80% usage)
- Add production-specific warnings for SQLite and empty databases

Documentation Updates:
- Add Railway PostgreSQL setup guide with DATABASE_URL linking instructions
- Add three troubleshooting scenarios with solutions
- Add post-deployment verification steps
- Add quick reference commands for health checks and diagnostics
- Update .env.example with PostgreSQL connection string examples

This resolves the organization data loss issue on Railway deployments by ensuring
the application connects to persistent PostgreSQL instead of ephemeral SQLite.
