feat: implement comprehensive AI Developer Workflow (ADW) system with logging

- Created complete ADW directory structure with agent execution framework
- Built multi-agent orchestration system for parallel agent execution
- Implemented comprehensive logging system with structured JSON output
- Added domain-specific context for Cromie's architecture
- Created slash command templates for /implement and /implement-with-adw
- Built workflow scripts for prompt, slash command, and feature implementation
- Added Python virtual environment with all required dependencies

Logging Features:
- Structured JSON logging with multi-level tracking (workflow/phase/agent)
- Real-time streaming of Claude CLI output
- Performance metrics collection (execution time, memory, CPU)
- Event-based logging with correlation IDs
- Error aggregation and analysis tools
- Log rotation and archiving support
- Multiple formatters (JSON, Rich Console, CSV, HTML)

ADW Features:
- Multi-agent orchestration with ThreadPoolExecutor
- Claude Code CLI integration via subprocess
- Domain-aware context for Slack commands and time tracking
- Issue parsing from markdown specification files
- JSON result aggregation from parallel executions
- Automatic virtual environment management

Documentation:
- Comprehensive logging architecture documentation
- Python logging patterns for AI agents
- Implementation plan with phased rollout
- Usage examples and best practices
