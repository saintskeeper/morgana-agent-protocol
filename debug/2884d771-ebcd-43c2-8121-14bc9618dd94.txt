feat: add user profile caching with name history tracking and ADW automation improvements

Implement comprehensive user profile caching system to resolve users by historical names and improve ADW workflow automation.

User Profile Features:
- Add profile fields (DisplayName, RealName, Email, FirstName, LastName, PreviousNames, LastProfileSync)
- Create user_profile.go with name history helper methods (GetNameHistory, AddToNameHistory, HasUsedName)
- Implement ProfileSyncService with 6-hour automatic background sync
- Add database indexes for fast case-insensitive name lookups
- Track up to 20 historical name changes per user

New Admin Commands:
- /cromie admin sync-users: manually trigger profile sync
- /cromie admin find-user <name>: search by current or historical names
- /cromie admin user-info @user: display profile with name history

ADW Workflow Improvements:
- Add --dangerously-skip-permissions flag for automated executions
- Add explicit permissions grant section to prompts
- Create adw/.gitignore to exclude Python cache files
- Implement PromptBuilder and SurgicalAnalyzer modules
- Add single-agent surgical precision workflow

Bug Fixes:
- Fix context variable name conflict in main.go graceful shutdown
- Update test signatures for NewSlackEventsHandler with syncService parameter
- Add context import to slack_events.go

This enables resolving users by old names even after Slack profile changes.
