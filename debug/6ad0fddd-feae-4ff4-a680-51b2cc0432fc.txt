feat: implement user-friendly Slack commands (Phases 2-6)

Implements comprehensive UX improvements for Slack command handling:

Phase 2 - Enhanced Error Messages:
- Add parseSlackMentionWithContext with educational error messages
- Provide step-by-step guidance on correct user mention usage
- Update all admin handlers with actionable error responses

Phase 3 - Intelligent User Lookup Fallback:
- Add findUserByDisplayNameOrEmail for smart user search
- Fallback to name/email matching when mention parsing fails
- Search by display name, real name, and email (exact + partial)
- Maintain organization-level security isolation

Phase 4 - Command Suggestions for Typos:
- Implement Levenshtein distance algorithm for fuzzy matching
- Add suggestCommand with distance threshold of 2
- Provide "Did you mean" suggestions for mistyped commands
- Context-aware suggestions (different for admins vs users)

Phase 5 - Rich Interactive Help Commands:
- Completely rewrite help commands with rich formatting
- Add context-aware content (different for admins vs regular users)
- Include visual emojis, code blocks, and structured sections
- Add built-in troubleshooting and user mention instructions

Phase 6 - Support Quoted Arguments:
- Implement parseCommandArgs supporting quoted multi-word strings
- Replace strings.Fields with quote-aware parser
- Handle escape sequences (backslashes, quotes)
- Enable multi-word client names: /cromie admin add-client "Big Tech Corp"

Infrastructure:
- Fix Dockerfile Alpine package installation with retry logic
- Add 140+ comprehensive test cases across all phases
- Update test files for new function signatures

All implementations are backward compatible and production-ready.
