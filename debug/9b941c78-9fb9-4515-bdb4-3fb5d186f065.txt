## Screen Size Best Practices

Modern game development requires designing for a wide range of resolutions and screen sizes [1][2]. The most common target resolution is **1920×1080** (Full HD), which dominates desktop and console gaming at 16:9 aspect ratio [3][1]. However, 2560×1440 (QHD) has grown significantly, with Steam reporting almost 10% increase in usage by early 2025 [4][5].

### Target Resolution Ranges

For desktop games, design within the range of **1280×720 through 2560×1440**, with Full HD as your primary target [2]. The 16:9 aspect ratio accounts for approximately 89% of PC gaming setups, making it the essential baseline [6][7]. Mobile games should target viewport widths between **360px and 430px**, covering the majority of mobile devices [2][8].

### Aspect Ratio Support

While 16:9 dominates, supporting additional aspect ratios improves accessibility [6]:

- **16:10** represents 5.16% of users (common on older laptops and monitors)
- **21:9** ultrawide accounts for 2.51% (gaining popularity among enthusiasts)
- **4:3** legacy support at 0.95% (optional for broader compatibility)

Use pillarboxing or letterboxing when your game cannot fully respond to different aspect ratios [9].

### Resolution Scaling Standards

Design your game to render clearly across different DPIs without appearing blurry, pixelated, or stretched [9][10]. Common scaling resolutions include:

- 1280×720 (HD) - budget devices and lower-end systems
- 1920×1080 (Full HD) - standard gaming resolution
- 2560×1440 (QHD) - high-end monitors
- 3840×2160 (4K UHD) - premium displays [1]

Ensure UI elements scale appropriately by using vector graphics or scalable sprites rather than low-resolution rasterized assets [9][10].

## Window Manager Best Practices

### Fullscreen Modes

Games should offer three display modes for maximum flexibility [11][12]:

**Exclusive Fullscreen** provides the best performance by giving the game direct control of the display, bypassing the compositor [13][12]. This mode is ideal for competitive gaming where frame timing matters most [11].

**Borderless Windowed** (also called windowed fullscreen) displays the game in a maximized window without decorations, covering the entire screen [12]. This mode allows seamless alt-tabbing and multi-monitor workflows without minimizing the game [14]. Modern APIs like DirectX 12 have largely eliminated performance penalties, making borderless windowed increasingly popular [14].

**Windowed Mode** presents the game in a traditional resizable window, useful for development and users who prefer managing multiple applications [15].

### Implementation Guidelines

When implementing window management, default to borderless windowed for user convenience unless your game requires exclusive fullscreen for technical reasons [14][12]. Always respect the user's desktop resolution in borderless mode rather than forcing a specific resolution [13].

For framework-specific implementation, Love2D defaults to borderless fullscreen, but you can specify exclusive fullscreen with `t.window.fullscreentype = 'exclusive'` in conf.lua [13]. Many games mislabel borderless windowed as simply "fullscreen," which can confuse users expecting exclusive mode behavior [16][12].

### Responsive UI Design

Game UIs must adapt to different screen sizes using fluid layouts with relative units rather than fixed pixels [10]. Position UI elements using anchoring systems (health bar top-left, pause button top-right, scoreboard centered) to prevent overlap across resolutions [10].

For Love2D specifically, use resolution-handling libraries like **push** to maintain a fixed internal game resolution while automatically scaling to the window size [17]. This approach lets you design for one resolution while supporting any display size [18][17].

Ensure touch targets are at least 48×48 pixels for mobile-friendly controls, and maintain text legibility with contrast ratios of at least 4.5:1 for small text [9][10]. Test across multiple screen sizes during development rather than designing for a single device [10][19].
