# Feature: User Timezone Support

## Overview
Enable users to set their timezone preferences so daily time entry prompts are sent at the correct local time (e.g., 9am in their timezone rather than UTC).

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Users can specify their timezone during onboarding
- Admins can update user timezones in the admin dashboard
- Daily prompts respect individual user timezones
- Time entries display in user's local timezone

### Technical Requirements
- Store timezone as IANA timezone string (e.g., "America/New_York")
- Use Go's `time` package for timezone handling
- Update scheduler to calculate per-user send times
- Validate timezone strings on input

### Dependencies
- Existing `users` table in database
- Slack user profile integration
- Goroutine scheduler system

## Architecture Changes

### Component Interactions
```
Scheduler → User Model (timezone) → time.LoadLocation() → Scheduled Send Time
```

### Data Flow
1. User timezone stored in database
2. Scheduler queries all active users
3. For each user, calculate next send time in their timezone
4. Schedule goroutine to send at calculated time

### API Changes
- Add timezone field to user creation/update endpoints
- Add timezone validation middleware

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database & Model Updates

#### 📝 EDIT: `app/server/internal/models/user.go` (lines 12-25)
- Add `Timezone string` field to User struct
- Add validation tag: `validate:"required,timezone"`
- Set default value: "UTC"
```go
type User struct {
    ID             uuid.UUID `gorm:"type:uuid;primary_key"`
    OrganizationID uuid.UUID `gorm:"type:uuid;not null"`
    SlackUserID    string    `gorm:"uniqueIndex;not null"`
    Timezone       string    `gorm:"default:'UTC';not null" validate:"timezone"`
    Role           string    `gorm:"type:varchar(20);default:'user'"`
    Active         bool      `gorm:"default:true"`
    CreatedAt      time.Time
    UpdatedAt      time.Time
}
```

#### 📝 EDIT: `app/server/pkg/database/database.go` (lines 45-50)
- Add migration to add timezone column to users table
- Set default 'UTC' for existing users

### Phase 2: Timezone Validation

#### ✨ NEW: `app/server/pkg/validation/timezone.go`
- Create timezone validator function
- Use `time.LoadLocation()` to validate IANA strings
- Return error for invalid timezones
```go
func ValidateTimezone(tz string) error {
    _, err := time.LoadLocation(tz)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid timezone: %s", tz)
    }
    return nil
}
```

### Phase 3: API Endpoints

#### 📝 EDIT: `app/server/internal/api/handlers/admin.go` (lines 150-180, 250-275)
- Update CreateUser handler to accept timezone parameter
- Update UpdateUser handler to allow timezone updates
- Add timezone validation before saving
- Return error if timezone is invalid

Example changes:
```go
// Line 155: Add timezone to user creation
func (h *AdminHandler) CreateUser(c *gin.Context) {
    var req struct {
        SlackUserID string `json:"slack_user_id" binding:"required"`
        Timezone    string `json:"timezone" binding:"required"`
        Role        string `json:"role"`
    }
    
    // Validate timezone
    if err := validation.ValidateTimezone(req.Timezone); err != nil {
        c.JSON(400, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
        return
    }
    // ... rest of handler
}
```

### Phase 4: Slack Integration

#### 📝 EDIT: `app/server/internal/slack/client.go` (lines 80-100)
- Add GetUserTimezone() method
- Fetch timezone from Slack user profile
- Fallback to 'UTC' if not available
```go
func (c *SlackClient) GetUserTimezone(userID string) (string, error) {
    user, err := c.api.GetUserInfo(userID)
    if err != nil {
        return "UTC", err
    }
    
    if user.TZ != "" {
        return user.TZ, nil
    }
    return "UTC", nil
}
```

#### ✨ NEW: `app/server/internal/api/handlers/sync_timezones.go`
- Create admin endpoint to sync timezones from Slack
- Batch update users with their Slack timezone
- Handle errors gracefully

### Phase 5: Scheduler Updates

#### 📝 EDIT: `app/server/cmd/main.go` (lines 75-120)
- Update scheduler initialization
- Calculate per-user send times based on timezone
- Replace single daily cron with per-user scheduling

```go
// Line 85: New scheduling logic
func scheduleUserMessages() {
    users := getUsersWithTimezones()
    
    for _, user := range users {
        go scheduleForUser(user)
    }
}

func scheduleForUser(user models.User) {
    loc, _ := time.LoadLocation(user.Timezone)
    now := time.Now().In(loc)
    
    // Calculate next 9am in user's timezone
    next9am := time.Date(now.Year(), now.Month(), now.Day(), 9, 0, 0, 0, loc)
    if now.After(next9am) {
        next9am = next9am.Add(24 * time.Hour)
    }
    
    duration := next9am.Sub(time.Now())
    time.AfterFunc(duration, func() {
        sendDailyMessage(user)
        scheduleForUser(user) // Reschedule for next day
    })
}
```

### Phase 6: Frontend Updates

#### 📝 EDIT: `app/client/app/(dashboard)/users/page.tsx` (lines 45-60, 120-150)
- Add timezone column to users table
- Add timezone dropdown in create/edit user forms
- Use `Intl.supportedValuesOf('timeZone')` for timezone list

#### 📝 EDIT: `app/client/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx` (lines 30-80)
- Add personal timezone setting
- Allow users to update their own timezone
- Show current timezone with validation

#### ✨ NEW: `app/client/components/timezone-select.tsx`
- Reusable timezone selector component
- Grouped by region (Americas, Europe, Asia, etc.)
- Search functionality
```tsx
export function TimezoneSelect({ value, onChange }: Props) {
  const timezones = Intl.supportedValuesOf('timeZone');
  
  return (
    <Select value={value} onValueChange={onChange}>
      {timezones.map(tz => (
        <SelectItem key={tz} value={tz}>{tz}</SelectItem>
      ))}
    </Select>
  );
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- ✨ NEW: `app/server/pkg/validation/timezone_test.go`
  - Test valid IANA timezones
  - Test invalid timezone strings
  - Test edge cases (UTC, GMT offsets)

- 📝 EDIT: `app/server/internal/models/user_test.go`
  - Test user creation with timezone
  - Test timezone validation in model

### Integration Tests
- Test timezone sync from Slack API
- Test scheduler with multiple users in different timezones
- Test API endpoints with timezone updates

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Create users with different timezones
2. Verify scheduled messages sent at correct local time
3. Update user timezone and verify next message time
4. Test frontend timezone selector
5. Verify timezone displays correctly in admin dashboard

## Rollout Plan

### Deployment Steps
1. Run database migration to add timezone column
2. Deploy backend with new timezone logic
3. Run timezone sync script to populate from Slack
4. Deploy frontend with timezone UI
5. Monitor scheduler for correct timing

### Monitoring Requirements
- Log scheduled message times with timezone info
- Alert if scheduler fails for specific timezone
- Track timezone validation errors
- Monitor Slack API calls for timezone sync

### Rollback Procedure
1. Revert scheduler to UTC-only mode
2. Keep timezone column but ignore in queries
3. Hide timezone UI in frontend
4. Database migration rollback if needed

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1-2** (Database & Validation): 2 hours
- **Phase 3** (API Endpoints): 3 hours
- **Phase 4** (Slack Integration): 2 hours
- **Phase 5** (Scheduler): 4 hours
- **Phase 6** (Frontend): 4 hours
- **Testing**: 3 hours
- **Total**: ~18 hours (2-3 days)

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Issues
1. **Scheduler Complexity**: Managing multiple goroutines per user could be memory-intensive
   - **Mitigation**: Consider using `robfig/cron` with per-user cron expressions

2. **Timezone Data Inconsistency**: Slack timezone might differ from user preference
   - **Mitigation**: Allow manual override, prioritize manual setting over Slack

3. **DST Transitions**: Daylight saving time could cause missed/duplicate messages
   - **Mitigation**: Use `time.LoadLocation()` which handles DST automatically

4. **Migration Impact**: Adding NOT NULL column to existing users table
   - **Mitigation**: Set default 'UTC' value, run sync before enforcing validation

5. **Frontend Timezone List**: Long list may be overwhelming
   - **Mitigation**: Add search/filter, group by region, show common timezones first

## Notes
- Consider adding timezone abbreviation display (EST, PST, etc.)
- Future: Auto-detect timezone from user's browser
- Future: Respect user's working hours (not just 9am)
