The solution should: 1) Add database columns to cache Slack profile data (display_name, real_name, email, first_name, last_name, previous_names JSON array, last_profile_sync timestamp), 2) Implement automatic profile syncing on user creation and periodic background updates, 3) Track name change history in a JSON array, 4) Always use Slack IDs as the primary reference internally while names are just for display, 5) Update the resolveUser function to search cached profiles first before hitting Slack API, 6) Add admin commands for manual sync and user discovery, 7) Include database migrations with proper indexes for fast lookups. This is critical because users are currently unable to be found after changing their Slack names, breaking admin assignment commands."
