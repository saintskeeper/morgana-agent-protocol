fix(auth): implement local development authentication with test credentials

- Add mock authentication support for local development in OIDC and Keycloak strategies
- Enable test user login with testuser@proflyt.mil / testpassword credentials
- Implement missing KeycloakServiceStrategy methods (loginUser, refreshUser, logoutUser)
- Add seed script to create test user in MongoDB
- Fix TypeScript errors in mock User objects with all required properties
- Update Angular configuration to use buildTarget instead of deprecated browserTarget
- Add local development setup scripts for RabbitMQ and Keycloak
- Add Makefile for easier local development workflow

This fix allows developers to authenticate in local environment without requiring
a fully configured Keycloak instance, improving development experience.
