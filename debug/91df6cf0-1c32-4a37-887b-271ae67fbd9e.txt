fix: correct timezone handling for time entry dates

Time entries were showing incorrect dates when created near midnight
due to UTC conversion. Entries created at 9:53 PM EDT on Oct 13 showed
as Oct 14 because the server stored UTC time (1:53 AM Oct 14).

Changes:
- Store entry dates in user's local timezone from Slack profile
- Convert displayed dates to user's timezone in /cromie list
- Sync timezone from Slack during user creation and profile updates
- Apply timezone conversion to delete confirmation messages

Fixes date display accuracy for users in all timezones.
