fix: prevent organization data loss on Railway deployment

Implement comprehensive database validation and deployment safeguards to prevent
organization data loss when deploying to Railway. Addresses critical production
issue where DATABASE_URL changes caused empty database state.

Changes:
- Add database validation layer with ValidateData() and GetDatabaseStats()
- Implement startup validation logging in main.go with production warnings
- Create health check endpoints (/health and /health/db) with database stats
- Improve OAuth callback to properly handle create vs update operations
- Add intelligent retry with progressive backoff to deployment script (2-5 min)
- Create pre-deployment database state verification
- Add post-deployment database verification with health checks

Documentation:
- Add Railway PostgreSQL setup guide (infrastructure/docs/RAILWAY_DATABASE_SETUP.md)
- Add comprehensive troubleshooting guide (infrastructure/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- Document 50+ diagnostic commands and recovery procedures

The deployment script now waits intelligently for Railway builds to complete with
progressive retry intervals (30s, 30s, 45s, 45s, 60s, 60s, 90s) up to 6 minutes,
providing clear progress feedback and automatic health verification.
