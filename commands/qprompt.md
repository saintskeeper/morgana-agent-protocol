# Prompt Helper Command

You've asked to use a structured prompt template. I'll help you format your
request using the token-efficient prompt patterns.

## How to use this command:

1. Tell me what type of task you have:

   - `simple` - Direct task execution
   - `analyze` - Code review, analysis, validation
   - `implement` - Code generation, feature implementation
   - `test` - Test generation
   - `plan` - Sprint planning

2. Provide the details, and I'll structure it using the appropriate template.

## Example usage:

```
/qprompt analyze - review auth.service.ts for security
/qprompt implement - add user profile feature with avatar upload
/qprompt test - create tests for PaymentProcessor class
```

I'll then show you the structured prompt and execute it.
