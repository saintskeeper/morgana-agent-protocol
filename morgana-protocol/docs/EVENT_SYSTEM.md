# Morgana Protocol Event System

The Morgana Protocol event system provides thread-safe, high-performance pub/sub
messaging for tracking task execution, orchestrator operations, and system
events.

## Architecture Overview

The event system consists of several key components:

- **EventBus**: Thread-safe pub/sub system with async processing
- **CircularBuffer**: Lock-free buffer for high-performance event queuing
- **Event Types**: Strongly-typed events for different system operations
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with Adapter and Orchestrator

## Performance Characteristics

Benchmark results on Apple M1 Max:

- **Sync Publishing**: ~17M events/sec (59ns/op)
- **Async Publishing**: ~5M events/sec (203ns/op)
- **Overhead**: ~7x compared to direct function call (66ns vs 9ns)
- **Memory**: Zero allocations after initialization
- **Concurrency**: Fully thread-safe, lock-free buffer operations

The system easily meets the <5% performance overhead requirement when using
async publishing.

## Event Types

### Task Lifecycle Events

- `EventTaskStarted`: Emitted when a task begins execution
- `EventTaskProgress`: Emitted during task execution to show progress
- `EventTaskCompleted`: Emitted when a task completes successfully
- `EventTaskFailed`: Emitted when a task fails

### Orchestrator Events

- `EventOrchestratorStarted`: Emitted when orchestrator begins execution
- `EventOrchestratorCompleted`: Emitted when orchestrator completes
- `EventOrchestratorFailed`: Emitted when orchestrator fails

### Adapter Events

- `EventAdapterValidation`: Emitted during adapter validation
- `EventAdapterPromptLoad`: Emitted during prompt loading
- `EventAdapterExecution`: Emitted during task execution phases

## Basic Usage

### Creating an Event Bus

```go
import "github.com/saintskeeper/claude-code-configs/morgana-protocol/internal/events"

// Create with default configuration
config := events.DefaultBusConfig()
eventBus := events.NewEventBus(config)
defer eventBus.Close()
```

### Configuration Options

```go
config := events.BusConfig{
    BufferSize:    10000,  // Event buffer size
    Workers:       4,      // Worker goroutines
    Debug:         false,  // Debug logging
    RecoverPanics: true,   // Recover from subscriber panics
}
```

### Subscribing to Events

```go
// Subscribe to specific event types
subID := eventBus.Subscribe(events.EventTaskStarted, func(event events.Event) {
    if startEvent, ok := event.(*events.TaskStartedEvent); ok {
        log.Printf("Task started: %s [%s]", startEvent.TaskID(), startEvent.AgentType)
    }
})

// Subscribe with filter
eventBus.SubscribeWithFilter(events.EventTaskStarted, events.SubscriberWithFilter{
    Handler: func(event events.Event) {
        log.Printf("Important task: %s", event.TaskID())
    },
    Filter: func(event events.Event) bool {
        return strings.Contains(event.TaskID(), "important")
    },
})

// Subscribe to all events
eventBus.SubscribeAll(func(event events.Event) {
    log.Printf("Event: %s - %s", event.Type(), event.TaskID())
})

// Unsubscribe
eventBus.Unsubscribe(subID)
```

### Publishing Events

```go
// Create event
ctx := context.Background()
taskID := events.GenerateTaskID()

event := events.NewTaskStartedEvent(
    ctx, taskID, "code-implementer", "Test task",
    nil, 0, "", "", time.Minute)

// Publish synchronously (blocks until processed)
eventBus.Publish(event)

// Publish asynchronously (non-blocking)
if !eventBus.PublishAsync(event) {
    log.Println("Event dropped - buffer full")
}
```

## Integration with Existing Components

### Adapter Integration

The adapter automatically publishes events during task execution:

```go
// Create adapter
adapter := adapter.New(promptLoader, taskClient, tracer)

// Set event bus
adapter.SetEventBus(eventBus)

// Events are automatically published during Execute()
result := adapter.Execute(ctx, task)
```

Events published:

1. `TaskStartedEvent` - When task begins
2. `TaskProgressEvent` - During validation, prompt loading, execution
3. `TaskCompletedEvent` - On successful completion
4. `TaskFailedEvent` - On failure at any stage

### Orchestrator Integration

The orchestrator publishes events for batch operations:

```go
// Create orchestrator
orch := orchestrator.New(adapter, maxConcurrency, tracer)

// Set event bus
orch.SetEventBus(eventBus)

// Events are automatically published during RunSequential/RunParallel
results := orch.RunParallel(ctx, tasks)
```

Events published:

1. `OrchestratorStartedEvent` - When batch execution begins
2. `OrchestratorCompletedEvent` - When batch execution completes
3. Individual task events from adapter

## Advanced Features

### Task ID Context Management

```go
// Generate unique task ID
taskID := events.GenerateTaskID()

// Store in context
ctx = events.SetTaskIDInContext(ctx, taskID)

// Retrieve from context
taskID = events.GetTaskIDFromContext(ctx)
```

### Event Metrics

```go
metrics := events.NewEventMetrics()

// Record event occurrence
metrics.RecordEvent(events.EventTaskStarted)

// Get event count
count := metrics.GetEventCount(events.EventTaskStarted)
```

### Bus Statistics

```go
stats := eventBus.Stats()
fmt.Printf("Published: %d, Dropped: %d\n", stats.TotalPublished, stats.TotalDropped)
fmt.Printf("Queue: %d/%d, Subscribers: %d\n",
    stats.QueueSize, stats.QueueCapacity, stats.ActiveSubscribers)
```

## Error Handling

The event system includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Panic Recovery**: Subscriber panics are automatically recovered
- **Buffer Overflow**: Events are dropped when buffer is full (tracked in stats)
- **Graceful Shutdown**: `Close()` processes remaining events before shutdown
- **Thread Safety**: All operations are fully thread-safe

## Best Practices

### Performance

- Use `PublishAsync()` for best performance (5M+ events/sec)
- Use `Publish()` only when you need synchronous processing
- Configure buffer size based on expected event volume
- Monitor drop rate via statistics

### Reliability

- Always call `eventBus.Close()` on shutdown
- Check return value of `PublishAsync()` for critical events
- Use filters to reduce unnecessary event processing
- Monitor subscriber performance to avoid slow consumers

### Debugging

- Enable `config.Debug = true` for development
- Use `SubscribeAll()` for comprehensive event logging
- Monitor statistics regularly for performance issues
