# Morgana Protocol - TODO

## High Priority (Blocking)

- [ ] Implement real Task tool integration in `pkg/task/client.go`
- [ ] Add timeout handling for agent execution
- [ ] Create integration tests with actual Claude Code

## Medium Priority (Important)

- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests (target: 80% coverage)
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add structured logging with levels (debug/info/warn/error)
- [ ] Create config file support (morgana.yaml)
- [ ] Improve error messages and user feedback

## Low Priority (Nice to Have)

- [ ] Add progress indicators for parallel execution
- [ ] Create interactive mode (`morgana --interactive`)
- [ ] Add metrics/telemetry support
- [ ] Build GitHub Actions workflow for releases
- [ ] Create Docker image for easy distribution
- [ ] Add shell completion scripts (bash/zsh)

## Documentation Needs

- [ ] Add godoc comments to all public functions
- [ ] Create examples/ directory with use cases
- [ ] Write troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Document Task tool integration details
- [ ] Add architecture diagram

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Unit tests for all packages
- [ ] Integration tests with mock Task tool
- [ ] E2E tests with real agents
- [ ] Benchmark tests for parallel execution
- [ ] Load testing with many concurrent agents
