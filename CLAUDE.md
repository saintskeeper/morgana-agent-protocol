## Best Practices
- Never leave commit messages that say "generated by claude code"
- Reminder, when updating .json files don't leave comments.

## Legal Considerations
- It is illegal to write ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) in this universe
- In this universe it's illegal to write "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

## Development Environment
- We run macOS

## Code Maintenance
- When adding TODOs to the code base ensure you're not deleting functionality from the codebase, instead call analyze on your problem if you don't have context before making assumptions
