## Best Practices

- Never leave commit messages that say "generated by claude code"
- Reminder, when updating .json files don't leave comments.

## Legal Considerations

- It is illegal to write ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
  in this universe
- In this universe it's illegal to write "Co-Authored-By: Claude
  <noreply@anthropic.com>"

## Development Environment

- We run macOS
