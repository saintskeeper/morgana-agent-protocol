# Sprint Plan: Fix Parallel Task Logging Visibility (VALIDATED)

## Sprint Overview

- **Sprint ID**: sprint-2025-01-07-logging-visibility
- **Duration**: 6-8 hours (reduced from 8-12 after validation)
- **Goal**: Enable visible logging output when running morgana parallel tasks
  through make attach
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Logs from parallel morgana tasks appear in attached TUI session
  - Both headless and TUI modes show proper logging
  - Event forwarding works correctly between morgana CLI and monitor daemon

## Problem Statement - VALIDATED ‚úÖ

After codebase analysis, the issue is confirmed: The `--client` mode in
morgana-monitor (cmd/morgana-monitor/main.go:42-67) creates a NEW IPC client
that tries to RECEIVE events, but the headless server doesn't properly REPLAY
buffered events to new clients. The architecture is actually well-designed but
missing event history replay.

## Updated Technical Analysis

### Current Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Working Components:**

- IPC Server properly receives events (internal/monitor/server.go:128-164)
- Client mode exists and connects (cmd/morgana-monitor/main.go:42-67)
- Event reconstruction works (internal/monitor/server.go:167-249)
- TUI can display events when connected from start

‚ùå **Missing Components:**

- No event buffering in IPC server for replay
- Client mode doesn't request event history
- No bidirectional communication protocol for replay

### Code Locations Identified

1. **cmd/morgana-monitor/main.go**:

   - Lines 42-67: Client mode implementation (needs enhancement)
   - Lines 78-95: Headless mode (working correctly)

2. **internal/monitor/server.go**:

   - Lines 128-164: handleConnection (needs buffering)
   - Lines 167-249: reconstructEvent (working correctly)
   - Need to add: Event buffer storage and replay mechanism

3. **internal/monitor/client.go**:

   - Lines 97-120: forwardEvent (working correctly)
   - Need to add: Request history on connect

4. **internal/monitor/protocol.go**:
   - Need to add: New message types for history request/response

## REFINED Task Definitions

### Task 1: EVENT_BUFFER_IMPL ‚ö° (Simplified from original)

- **Priority**: P0 (Critical)
- **Type**: Implementation
- **Duration**: 2 hours (reduced from 2 hours in wrong place)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Files to Modify**:

      // ... existing fields
      eventBuffer    []IPCMessage
      bufferMutex    sync.RWMutex
      maxBufferSize  int
  }
  ```
- **Exit Criteria**:
  - Circular buffer stores last 1000 events in IPCServer

## Risk Mitigation - UPDATED

**Risk 1**: Breaking existing direct TUI mode (no --client flag)

- **Mitigation**: Only modify client mode path, leave direct mode untouched

**Risk 2**: Race condition in buffer access

- **Mitigation**: Use sync.RWMutex for all buffer operations

**Risk 3**: Memory growth from buffering

- **Mitigation**: Fixed circular buffer size (1000 events), ~100KB memory

## Validation Commands - VERIFIED ‚úÖ

```bash
# These commands reproduce the issue
make up                    # Starts headless mode ‚úÖ
morgana --parallel ...     # Sends events to server ‚úÖ
make attach               # Currently fails to show events ‚ùå

# After fix, same commands should work
make up
echo '[{"agent_type":"code-implementer","prompt":"Test"}]' | morgana --parallel
make attach  # Should show buffered events ‚úÖ
```

## Technical Insights from Validation

1. **Good News**: The architecture is sound - IPC communication works, events
   flow correctly, TUI renders properly
2. **Root Cause**: Missing event history replay for late-joining clients
3. **Minimal Changes**: Only need to add buffering and replay protocol, no major
   refactoring
4. **Performance**: Buffer of 1000 events is sufficient for typical debugging
   sessions

## Definition of Done - UPDATED

- [x] Codebase validated and root cause confirmed
- [ ] Event buffer implemented in IPCServer
- [ ] Replay protocol for historical events
- [ ] Client mode requests and displays history
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tested with 10+ parallel tasks

## Team Allocation - UPDATED

- **Single Developer**: Can complete all tasks (6-8 hours total)
- **Pair Programming**: Recommended for REPLAY_PROTOCOL_IMPL (critical
  component)

## Next Steps

1. Start with EVENT_BUFFER_IMPL (no dependencies)
2. Implement REPLAY_PROTOCOL_IMPL and HEADLESS_LOGGING in parallel
3. Complete CLIENT_MODE_ENHANCE
4. Test thoroughly with INTEGRATION_TEST
5. Polish with MAKEFILE_ATTACH_FIX and DOCS_UPDATE

The validated plan reduces complexity and duration by focusing on the actual
issue: event replay for late-joining clients.
